# PowerShell Batch Add Firewall Rules
This is a powershell script that allows you to select a path and add a firewall rule for every executable inside the directory aswell as the subdirectorys with the click of a button.
## What does it do?
This script gets every executable inside a given directory aswell as its sub directories and blocks inbound or/and outbound network traffic for these executables by creating individual firewall rules inside the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.
## Why use this?
Creating firewall rules manually for each executable in a directory, especially when dealing with multiple executables and subdirectories, is a time-consuming and tedious task. 

This PowerShell script automates the process, saving you significant time and effort. 
## How do i use this?
Just download the .ps1 file from this repository and run it with administrative privileges. 
If you launch it without administrative privileges, it will open a new powershell with the required privileges.

When you execute the script, you will be greeted with a GUI.

- **Choose Path Button:** Simply click the "Choose Path" button. This opens a Windows File Explorer window, allowing you to navigate and select the desired directory. This directory is where the script will search for executable files to create firewall rules for.

- **Path Label:** Once you've selected a directory, the path will be displayed inside the GUI. If you want to double-check the contents of the selected folder, just double-click the path label, and it will open the directory in Windows File Explorer for you to review.
  
- **Create Inbound Rules Button:** Click this button to block all inbound network traffic for every executable in the selected directory and its subdirectories. This action creates individual firewall rules for each executable within the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.
  
- **Create Outbound Rules Button:** Same thing as the Create Inbound Rules Button, but for Outbound traffic.

- **Enable Deletion Checkbox:** Tick the "Enable Deletion" checkbox to activate the delete buttons. This allows you to selectively enable or disable the functionality to delete firewall rules.

- **Delete Inbound Rules Button:** Once the deletion is enabled, click this button to delete previously created inbound network traffic rules for every executable in the selected directory and its subdirectories. This deletes them based on the names previously generated by this script, so it will only delete Traffic Rules that were created with this script or named exactly the same.

- **Delete Outbound Rules Button:** Same thing as Delete Inbound Rules Button, but for Outbound rules.
